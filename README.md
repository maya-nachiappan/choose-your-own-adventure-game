**WELCOME TO THE CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE GAME**

*Game Objective*
- The player must make it to the end of this interactive, text based game without dying.

*Overview*
- This C++ program allows the user to choose their own adventure while trying to get to the end of a magical castle. It primarily utilizes switch case statements to control the user input, along with functions for each choice a user can make.

*Features*
- There are multiple functions in the game which allow the user to increase their overall score as they go through the game.
- If the user chooses the wrong option, they die and the code is exited.
- The user gets to store weapons and special abilities in their inventory, as string variables.
- The program uses boolean variables to determine if a player has a special ability or not, and accordingly changes the output and options that a player can see.
- A random number generator determines the sequence of obstacles that a user can encounter, ensuring a unique experience for every player!
